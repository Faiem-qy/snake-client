# Snake Client Project

The Snake game is a very popular video game.
The player maneuvers the snake around the screen and it grows by ‘eating’ pieces of food(the dot). As it grows, the snake becomes an obstacle to itself.
The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
